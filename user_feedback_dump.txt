The new onboarding flow is confusing, especially on mobile.
App takes too long to load when switching tabs.
Great support, but the chatbot feels too scripted.
Wish there were more integrations with third-party tools.
The main menu labels are unclear — not intuitive.
Loading times have improved, but not on Android.
No dark mode yet, that's disappointing.
Love the new dashboard design.
Search sometimes shows irrelevant results.
Notifications don’t sync properly across devices.
Still no way to export data easily.
Performance is great on desktop, but laggy on iOS.
Need better tutorials for first-time users.
Some features are hidden too deep in the UI.
Crash rate seems lower now — good job.
